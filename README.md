Source engine maps in your website!

Minimalistic as possible -- Only renders the BSP with flat shading. No models or textures are loaded. Colors are guessed based on texture names.

Horribly coded, but fairly efficient. Built with emscripten.

## Current Issues
- Models are all dumped at the origin.
- Displacements are unsupported.
